This presentation focuses on Efficient Text Document Indexing by utilizing four key advanced data structures : the Suffix Tree for fast substring and pattern matching , the Red-Black Tree to maintain a balanced and sorted structure for indexed data , the Inverted Index to provide fast full-text search by mapping terms to their occurrences , and the Trie (Prefix Tree) to enable efficient prefix-based searches and autocompletion features. The goal is to build a solution for indexing and searching large text documents with minimal retrieval time.
